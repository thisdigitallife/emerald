title: The Valley Of Flowers Trek Project
---
## The Mighty (& Skip at will) Introduction

Well, it's that time of the year when people flood the valley of flowers trek in drones and mules. The valley of flowers is a small alley in the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve and hosts a lot of Flora and fauna(plants and animals species if you please). If you follow the Himalayan Club group on Facebook, you will see that every alternate post has something to do with Valley of Flowers in the months July & August.

So why do I call this a project? Well, a post from a fellow trekker mentioned that we visit this trek just for the sake of it - the valley of flowers of different colors. He suggested that there is so much more to it than just flowers. Asking guidance from the senior Himalayan Club members , a number of people pitched in with there views. But a Facebook group thread is hardly a good place to store information for a topic - more suited for a conversation. That's what got me started with this project

So what do I intend to write here, you ask? I want to make this an authorative go to place for all information on The Valley. Be it  pictures, information on trek routes, travel information to and fro, information on plants and animals species found there, early exploration information, links to other people travelogues and all that. This page will have something in it for everyone who is seeking information about this mystic land

As you might agree, it's better to catalog the information in multiple sub posts : each dealing with a specific area of interest. This page will serve as a cover page for all that information properly arranged. 

*I don't wish to be seen as an expert on the area, just a librarian who arranges it's books on the shelves*

What I am not willing to write is my own travelogue here. **Hell, I have never been to this place, yet :)**

With all that might information, let's get started with the section below. Feel free to browse as per you choice of order and area of interest 

*As might be obvious, more to come ;)*
